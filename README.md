Colors is a real-time themepicker for 100r themes.

[100r themes](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Themes) allows developers to add the functionality of drag and drop svg files to their applications to change the color theme of the application. I really liked the simplicity of it and was using it for a couple of my web projects and I decided to create a web extension to change the colors in realtime which helps making the custom themes alot easier.
